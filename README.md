# Find my vaccination centre IOS app

This project represents an IOS phone application to find your local vaccination centre. The data used in this project is fictional and does not make use of existing data bases/servers.

The app shows a table view of the vaccination centres and if you press on one, it will show you a map view with some extra information about the vaccination centre and it's location on the map.

# Software used

Xcode Version 12.4 (12D4e)

# Disclaimer

This project was an assignment given by the Erasmus university college Brussels, for the IOS development course given by Johan Van Den Broek. The computer used while building this app is from Huei Li Yap. This is the reason why you will see her name mentioned in the comments of files. (auto-generated by xcode) She did not work on this project but I would like to thank her for lending me her laptop.
